# Basic R Syntax

This will be short, I promise.

## The absolute most important part of syntax ... {.build}

**Comments** 
:::

Comments are started by the `#` character

Some comments have special meaning.

>    - `#'` documentation comment
>    - `#!` sometimes configuration comments
>    - `#<` hey i'm talking about this comment.

## Assignments

* `a <- 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `a`.
* `a = 1` does the same, *generally*.
    + The generally is why this is also generally discouraged.

## Variables {.build}

* Variables "can" include:
   - letters (case-sensitive)
   - numbers, as long as it does not start with a number
   - period, if it starts with a period it is 'hidden'
   - underscore, but may not start with underscore
* But if you want to be fancy use back ticks `\`` and you can do whatever you want.

```{r "Long name assignments"}
`A variable name that is actually informative` <- 
    "A string that is not"
`A variable name that is actually informative`
```

## Functions {.build}

* create a function with 
```{r "Hello world function creation"}
hello_world <- function(who = 'world', how = 'hello'){
    print(paste(how, who))
}
```
* Now call the function with
```{r "Calling the hello_world function"}
hello_world()
```

## Vectors {.build}

* In R everything is a vector
* Sequential vectors can be created with `:`
```{r "sequence operator"}
a <- 1:5
```
* Create longer vectors by combining smaller vectors
```{r "Combine operator"}
b <- c(a, 6, 7, 8)
```

### Types 
:::{.columns-3}
* integer
* numeric
* logical
* list (i.e. anything)
* *language*
:::

## Vector Operations {.build}

```{r Comments}
# Comments use the '#' character
```
```{r "Obvious Operators"}
# Most operations are obvious
length(b)
sort(b)
class(b)
```

## Indexing (2-types)  {.build}

:::::: {.columns-2}
::: {.column}
* `[` - subsetting
  - preserves class
  - multiple indices
:::
::: {.column}
* `[[` - extraction
  - no guarantee of class
  - single index
:::
::::::

```{r Lists}
# A list holds anything
a <- list(first=1L, second=2, FALSE)
```

:::::: {.columns-2}
::: {.column}
```{r "single bracket indexing"}
# by position
class(a[1])
# by name
class(a['second'])
```
:::
::: {.column}
```{r "Double bracket indexing"}
# by position
class(a[[1]])
# by name
class(a[['second']])
```
:::
::::::

## `$` Indexing

lists may also be indexed by the `$` sign.

*But be careful not all vectors can be.*

```{r "Dollar indexing"}
a$first
a$second
```

This comes in useful for data.

## Data Types

### Data for our purpose is:
> * A (named) list of variables,
>   - where all variables have the same length;
> * Rectangular with  and rows as observations.
>   - columns as variables `ncol(iris)=``r ncol(iris)`
>   - and rows as observations `nrow(iris)=``r nrow(iris)`
